# TIM - Time Is Money

This is a small command-line tool to track times and commit those times into invoice items and ultimately invoices.
It is a rewrite of my [first nodejs project](https://github.com/wullxz/tim) in python.

# Requirements

pip packages:
- relatorio
- sqlalchemy

other:
- LibreOffice to edit the template
- sqlite3
